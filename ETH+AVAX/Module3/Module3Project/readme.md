### Interface and Abstract Fucntions use
#To Run the above codes :
1. Open the ##Remix## editor from here [https://remix.ethereum.org/]
2. Open both the files in two *different tabs*.
3. Now compile each file.
4. Deploy the **exampleContract.sol** file first.
5. Then open the interfaceCall.sol file and **Select** the ***interfaceExample*** contract and deploy it
   *****Note***: If you try to deploy directly , it will take the above contract i.e ICounter and we can not deploy it,  Because we can not deploy interface/abstract directly**

## Thank You
