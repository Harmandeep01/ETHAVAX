### Interface and Abstract Fucntions use
#To Run the above codes :
1. Open the **Remix** editor from here [https://remix.ethereum.org/]
2. Open both the files in two *different tabs*.
3. Now compile each file.
4. Deploy the **exampleContract.sol** file first.
5. Then open the interfaceCall.sol file and **Select** the ***interfaceExample*** contract and deploy it.
   
   *****Note***: If you try to deploy the contract directly , it will automatically takes the above contract by default i.e ICounter and
   as we know we can not deploy the interface/abstract directly.
      Hence we need to select appropriate contract before deploying**
